# Bilingual Bee
### The bilingual spelling quiz app

Bilingual Bee is an application created as a continuation of a project completed in the University of New England's unit [COSC570 - User Experience and Interaction Design](https://handbook.une.edu.au/units/2024/COSC570). This project was an exercise in Design Thinking, taking an application concept through the stages of Empathising, Defining, Ideation, Prototyping, and Testing.

Bilingual Bee is a work in progress.
It is a Python web app, built on the Django framework. It currently uses an SQLite database, but I plan to migrate to a PostGres database in the future.

The HTML/CSS frontend will also be supplemented with JavaScript and React in the near future.
